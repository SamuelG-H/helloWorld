# helloWorld
My first repository

Hello! My name is Samuel but I usually go by Sam.
In school I have enjoyed coding in C++ but unfortunately below average grades.
I'm a CS student and would like to improve my tech-knowledge(y) in my freetime!
I'm a fan of Daft Punk, clear night skies, and my family (one wife & one daughter).
